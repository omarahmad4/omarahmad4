# 👋 Hi, I’m Omar Farooq Ahmad

I'm a **Product-obsessed builder** with a strong technical foundation. Currently pursuing my **MBA at NYU Stern**, I bring an engineering-first mindset to product design, user experience, and systems thinking.

I studied **Computer Engineering at UCLA**, where I got hands-on with everything from embedded systems to chip design and multiplayer IoT games. Now, I'm exploring how technical innovation intersects with real-world user value — and I use this GitHub as a space to **prototype**, **learn**, and **ship**.

## 💡 What I’ve Been Building

### 🤖 Poker Playground – AI-Driven Coding Experiment with SwiftUI  
[View repo](https://github.com/omarahmad4/PokerPlayground)  
This project was a sandbox to test the **limits of AI-assisted software development**.

- Built entirely using **AI-generated code** (via ChatGPT and Copilot)  
- A fully functioning Texas Hold’em game for macOS using **SwiftUI**  
- Includes real poker logic, game flow, and a clean MVVM architecture

> 🧪 This wasn’t about learning Swift — it was about exploring how far AI tools can take an idea when the goal is speed, interactivity, and polish.

### 🎓 UCLA Capstone – Graduation LED Display & Pose-Based Multiplayer Game  
[View repo](https://github.com/omarahmad4/UCLA-180D-Design-Course)  
A 2-part capstone from undergrad focused on creative physical interfaces:
- **Part 1**: Turned graduation caps into synchronized LED pixels to display animations in real-time via Wi-Fi
- **Part 2**: Multiplayer game using Raspberry Pis, ultrasonic sensors, and OpenCV to detect proximity and poses
- Built using **Python**, **Bluetooth**, and **real-time control systems**

> 💡 A strong example of cross-functional teamwork, systems design, and building for experience at scale.

### 📚 UCLA Coursework Projects – From Malloc to Machine Vision  
[View repo](https://github.com/omarahmad4/UCLA-Projects-Courses)  
A full archive of hands-on projects from my Computer Engineering degree:
- Systems programming: memory allocators, TCP networking, embedded C
- Bash scripting, MATLAB, Python tools, OpenCV computer vision
- Logic programming (Prolog), functional programming (OCaml)
- Chip design with **Cadence** (schematics, layout, simulation)

> 🧠 These projects grounded my technical instincts and ability to dive deep when it counts.
